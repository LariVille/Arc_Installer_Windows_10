# Getting started:

First, Download [Arc.appinstaller](https://releases.arc.net/windows/prod/Arc.appinstaller) as it is required to install the Browser.

After that go to the [releases](https://github.com/LariVille/Arc_Installer_Windows_10/releases) and download the `.zip` file in the assets.

You should now have `Arc.appinstaller` and `Unofficial-Arc-Windows10-Installer.zip`.

Create a folder of where you want to install Arc, then put the content of `Arc-Windows10-Installer.zip` by extracting it inside of that folder.

Move `Arc.appinstaller` to where the `Arc Windows10 Installer.exe` is.

The folder should look like this:

Go to the Settings app on Windows (Win+I), Updates and Security > for Developers > Enable Developer Mode (you can disable it after using the installer)
